    This **AI-powered Invoice Extractor** is a student-developed innovation that blends real-world utility with modern technology. 
    Built using **Google‚Äôs Gemini AI** and **Streamlit**, it intelligently understands and reconstructs invoices‚Äîeven in **multiple languages** and **handwritten formats**.

    ### üåü Key Highlights:
    - ‚úÖ Advanced **keyword extraction** to fetch buyer/seller details, totals, and invoice metadata.
    - üß† Accurate **layout detection** to preserve the document structure.
    - üìã Capable of **extracting complex tables** with proper formatting.
    - üåê Supports **multilingual** documents for global use.
    - ‚úçÔ∏è Detects and reads **handwritten content** with impressive accuracy.
    
    This project reflects the **future-ready skills** our students are developing‚Äîcombining artificial intelligence, programming, and practical problem-solving to build tools that matter in industries like **finance, logistics, retail, and e-commerce**.
